Our goal in this part of the book is to give you a rapid overview of the main tools of data science: **importing**, **tidying**, **transforming**, and **visualizing data**, as shown in @fig-ds-whole-game.
We want to show you the "whole game" of data science giving you just enough of all the major pieces so that you can tackle real, if simple, datasets.
The later parts of the book, will hit each of these topics in more depth, increasing the range of data science challenges that you can tackle.

Five chapters focus on the tools of data science:

-   Visualisation is a great place to start with R programming, because the payoff is so clear: you get to make elegant and informative plots that help you understand data.
    In @sec-data-visualization you'll dive into visualization, learning the basic structure of a ggplot2 plot, and powerful techniques for turning data into plots.
